# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `CodeBlock`'s optional Shiki adapter highlights JSX and TSX with their own grammars.
- `Surface`: panel material with flat, raised and floating shadows, inherited or contrast appearance, and div-root replacement through `component` or `slots.root`. Card supports the same root replacement and native root `slotProps`.
- Drawer.Panel, BottomSheet.Panel and DialogStack.Content support div-root material replacement. Dialog.Panel adds the same customization while plain Dialog.Content children keep their default panel.
- `Pattern`: decorative SVG tiles (`stripes`, `diagonal`, `checks`, `dots`, `waves`, `chevron`) with continuous tile edges, token inks, tile sizes and scaling, including custom flipped-card artwork. Forced colors hides the pattern and preserves the enclosing surface and border.
- `GameHand`: card fans with keyboard selection and an explicit play action, plus count-only hidden opponent hands.
- `CardFlightsProvider` deals and plays cards between measured board slots, with themed overlays, interruptible flights and immediate reduced-motion landing.
- `TrickStacks`: keep up to three played cards per player at the table center, inspect stacks with the keyboard, and spread revealed hands. Preserves the original board placement by default; measured grid fitting is an explicit option. Includes RTL and reduced motion.
- `EditableDetails`: nested labelled details with independent app-owned editors, controlled disclosure, draft preservation on collapse, and keyboard focus recovery. Includes native form, React Action, React Hook Form, and overlay examples.

### Improved

- ActivityRings uses neutral tick rings, a central completion figure, flat legend rows and daily previews. Interactive legends preview metrics on hover or focus; amounts, percentages and inner surplus arcs animate together.
- Foundation guides use highlighted, copyable code examples and terminal commands with optional replay.
- `ToastStack` keeps a `contained` stack inside its host when consumer styles add padding to it.
- `ToastStack` casts a single shadow for a collapsed pile, so the cards behind it stay white instead of turning grey on light surfaces.
- `EditableDetails` uses aligned headings, quieter labels and separators only between rows. Nested sections no longer stack empty divider lines.
- Storybook groups `EditableDetails` form and picker examples under one Showcase entry.

### Changed

- GameCard no longer exports the internal rendering maps `RANK_MARKS`, `SUIT_GLYPHS` and `SUIT_INK`; card data types and `CARD_BACK_PATTERNS` remain public.
- GameCard backs use red-and-paper `Pattern` tiles: poker checks by default, or Spanish diagonals via `backPattern={CARD_BACK_PATTERNS.spanish}`. Custom artwork replaces either face.

### Fixed

- GameCard's French and Spanish deck galleries wrap into multiple columns instead of a 32px strip. FlipGameCard faces inherit the frame width, keeping corner radii consistent across sizes.
- Card flights wait for their animations before revealing landed cards, hide staggered cards until departure, and cancel replaced flights without a residual frame. GameHand supplies flight markers for visible cards and hidden hands with a player key.
- ActivityRings no longer reports a goal crossing when a completed goal is restored after being unavailable.
- Dialogs with short content keep a 320px minimum width, reduced to fit narrow viewports with 16px side gutters. Set size limits on Dialog.Content; set `minInlineSize: 0` to opt out of the default minimum.
- Card with `appearance="default"` inside a contrast parent keeps that appearance in descendant portals.
- BottomSheet and Dialog panels can publish contrast appearance to descendant portals. DialogStack panels retain declaration-site themes and scoped tokens through the stage portal.
- Drawer panels keep square attached corners on replacement material; BottomSheet panels keep square lower corners.
- Face-down GameCards no longer show a pale strip or pale corners through their ink border.
